Midibox mios32 with support for Audiothingies P6

This is a clone of the Midibox mios32 project (see www.ucapps.de), adding support for the Audiothingies P6
(www.audiothingies.com/p6) so that Midibox can be run on the P6.

Also started adding UI functionality to the Goom synthesizer (apps/synthesizers/goom) so that it can be edited
from the P6 front panel.

Currently work-in-progress.
