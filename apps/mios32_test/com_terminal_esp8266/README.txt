Required hardware:
   o MBHP_CORE_STM32 or MBHP_CORE_LPC17 or MBHP_CORE_STM32F4
   o MBHP_ESP8266

1) Default AT firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ESP-01 module comes with a default firmware which provides an so called
AT command interface.

See also
   http://www.pridopia.co.uk/pi-doc/ESP8266ATCommandsSet.pdf for the command set
   and https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/0/3/4A-ESP8266__AT_Instruction_Set__EN_v0.30.pdf
for further informations.


The MIOS32 app allows to send commands from the MIOS32 (MIDI) Terminal with:
!<command>
and it will display received messages.

E.g.
   !AT
should return
   OK


Initialisation Example for WLAN interface initialisation:
   !AT+CWMODE=3
   !AT+CWLAP
   !AT+CWJAP="<wifi-net>","<password>"
   !AT+CIFSR


2) Flash Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But we are not planning to use the AT firmware, but would like to flash our
own firmware with dedicated features instead.

The MBHP_ESP8266 based adaptor provides a special "bootloader" button to
enter flash programming mode.

It can be activated the following way:

- on the MBHP_ESP8266 module, press & hold the "Bootloader" button
- shortly trigger the reset button of this module
- now release the bootloader button

AT commands won't work anymore.

Instead, you can now use the "esp8266" commands provided by the MIOS32 terminal:
[334522.043]   esp8266 baudrate <baudrate>       changes the baudrate used by the MIOS32 core (current: 115200)
[334522.043]   esp8266 reset                     resets the chip
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_query          checks ESP8266 bootloader communication
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_erase_flash    erases the SPI Flash
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_prog_flash     programs a new ESP8266 firmware


Enter following command to check the connection to the ESP8266 bootloader:
   esp8266 bootloader_query

You should get following messages:
[334706.848] Connecting to ESP8266 in BootROM mode
[334706.848] Sync #1
[334706.848] [ESP8266_FW_Read] TIMEOUT (1)

[334707.148] Sync failed with status=-2, this can happen during first try - don't panic, we try again!

[334707.510] Chip ID: 0x00D2CE25
[334707.511] Flash ID: 0x001440E0
[334707.511] Flash Size: 1024k
[334707.511] Bootloader communication successfull!

It is normal that the first read operations timeout.
This is due to the auto-baudrate detection.

But at the end you should see the "bootloader communication successfull!" message.


In order to program our own firmware, enter following command:
   esp8266 bootloader_prog_flash

This will take several seconds - you should see messages like:



Again: it's normal that some timeout messages will appear.
At the end you should see a "programming done" message (and no error message).


The firmware will print messages such as:

3) MBHP_WIFI_BRIDGE Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I started to implement a firmware which allows to transfer OSC packets via WIFI.
The firmware is called MBHP_WIFI_BRIDGE and based on the SuperHouse esp-open-rtos
-> https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos


Once booted, enter the "!help" command -> this will forward "help" to the ESP8266 device.
It should print:
---
[239252.557] !help
[239252.563] Welcome to MBHP_WIFI_BRIDGE V0.1
[239252.566] Following commands are available:
[239252.572]   set network <network> <password>  connects to a WIFI network
[239252.574]   set udp_port <1..4> <port>        defines a UDP port
[239252.576]   system:                           print system info
[239252.580]   help:                             this page
---

Enter:
   !set network <network> <password>
to specify your WIFI network credentials, e.g.:
   !set network MyWiFi MySecretPassword

This command only has to be executed once, the credentials will be permanently stored in flash


Enter:
   !system
to get some system information which might be interesting:
---
